This is my nixie clock project source code.

Later I will post here more info about the project, like pictures, schematics and board layout.

Features:

  * Shows hours:minutes, temperature and humidity in a cyclic way.
  * Using one button the user can also check minutes:seconds, day:month and year.
  * Sensor used: DHT 22
  * RGB leds beneath the Nixies. The leds change colours slowly.
  * Integrated a NRF24L01 radio module to communicate with a remote temperature and humidity sensor station (the station project will also be hosted in this site).
  * PIR sensor to put the device in stand by when no one is nearby, increasing the Nixies lifetime.

Best regards,

Miguel
